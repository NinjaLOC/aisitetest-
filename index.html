        <h2>About CBD</h2>
        <p>CBD, or cannabidiol, is a natural compound found in the hemp plant. Unlike its cousin THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), CBD is non-psychoactive and does not cause the "high" commonly associated with marijuana. CBD oil is made by extracting CBD from the hemp plant, then diluting it with a carrier oil like coconut or hemp seed oil.</p>
